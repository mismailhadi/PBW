        <h3 style="color: white;">1. Lando Norris</h3>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">Norris made his debut at McLaren with relatively low expectations, after the team suffered years of poor performance. However, his partnership with Carlos Sainz brought new energy to the team, helping them finish fourth in the constructors' standings with twice as many points as in 2018.</p>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">The coronavirus pandemic disruption made Norris one of F1's stars in 2020 through his popular streaming content. The 2024 season finally brought a breakthrough victory for Norris, establishing him as a leading contender for the world championship and guiding McLaren to their first constructor's title since 1998. Off the track, Norris is known for his humble charm and artistic flair in designing his own racing gear.</p>

        <h3 style="color: white; margin-top: 40px;">2. Oscar Piastri</h3>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">Born in Melbourne, near the Australian Grand Prix circuit, Piastri's dream of racing in F1 began at a young age. His success flowed steadily, from runner-up in British F4, champion of Formula Renault, to consecutive championships in F3 and F2. Piastri didn't just climb the junior ranks; he stormed through them at breakneck speed.</p>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">In 2024, Piastri proved vital to McLaren's success in securing the constructors' world championship title. He pushed his more experienced teammate, Lando Norris, to his limits and scored remarkable victories in Hungary and Azerbaijan to finish fourth in the drivers' standings.</p>
