        <h3 style="color: white; margin-bottom: 15px;">1. Max Verstappen</h3>
        <p>He’s Max by name, and max by nature. Arriving as Formula 1’s youngest ever competitor at just 17 years old, Verstappen pushed his car, his rivals and the sport’s record books to the limit.</p>
        <p>A true wheel-to-wheel racer, another stunning drive in Brazil from the back of the pack to the podium on a treacherous wet track kept the plaudits coming. They led to his first F1 drivers’ crown after that now legendary, final-round showdown with Lewis Hamilton in 2021.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Having become the Netherlands' first world champion aged just 24, the expectations for the new generation’s leading light are sky high – but with Verstappen there’s a feeling that the sky’s the limit.</p>

        <h3 style="color: white; margin-bottom: 15px;">2. Liam Lawson</h3>
        <p>Liam Lawson knows a thing or two about jumping in at the deep end. A race winner at pretty much every level of junior motorsport, and a front-runner in the highly competitive F3 and F2 championships, the New Zealander was eagerly awaiting his F1 chance as Red Bull's reserve driver when fate gave him an opportunity.</p>
        <p>Of all places for it to unfold, Singapore sparked a second destiny. Ricciardo had to step aside, and Lawson stepped back in, this time as Red Bull sought to understand the “bigger picture” with their driver lineup for 2025 and beyond.</p>
