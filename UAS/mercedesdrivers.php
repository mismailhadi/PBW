        <h3 style="color: white;">1. George Russell</h3>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">George Russell lives by the motto: “When in doubt, go full throttle.” He has proven this since his debut season at Williams, culminating in his first victory with Mercedes in 2022. Russell demonstrated his immense potential by winning the 2017 GP3 and 2018 Formula 2 championships under intense pressure, which led to him being recruited into Mercedes' junior program</p>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">After proving himself as a hard worker and a determined talent, Russell will take the reins of the team starting in 2025 following Hamilton's move to Ferrari. Nicknamed ‘Russell the Rocket,’ he is ready to tackle the challenge of bringing the Silver Arrows back to the top of the standings and competing for the world championship title.</p>

        <h3 style="color: white; margin-top: 40px;">2. Andrea Kimi Antonelli</h3>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">Antonelli caught Mercedes' attention during his karting days and officially became a Mercedes junior driver in 2019. Despite suffering a severe leg injury in 2020, he made an incredible comeback by dominating the German and Italian F4 series in 2022, as well as winning Regional titles in the Middle East and Europe in 2023.</p>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">Mercedes took a bold step by promoting him directly to Formula 2 in 2024 at the age of 17. After completing his first official test using the W12 car at the Red Bull Ring, Mercedes announced that this young Italian talent will be Russell's teammate for the 2025 season.</p>
