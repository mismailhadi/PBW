        <h3 style="color: white;">1. Charles Leclerc</h3>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">Born amid the splendor of Monaco, Leclerc arrived in F1 amid huge expectations. Almost unrivaled in his journey to the GP3 and Formula 2 crowns, he showcased a dazzling array of skills, from blistering pole positions to commanding victories.</p>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">Stepping into F1 in 2018, Leclerc displayed flashes of ballistic speed on Saturdays and racing brilliance on Sundays, pushing his Sauber car beyond its limits. This extraordinary performance earned him the coveted racing seat at Ferrari for the 2019 season. Since then, he has become the heart of the Scuderia, known as ‘Il Predestinato’ by the Tifosi.</p>

        <h3 style="color: white; margin-top: 40px;">2. Lewis Hamilton</h3>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">Hamilton joined the McLaren F1 team in 2007 and immediately made history in his debut season. In 2014, he dominated the F1 season by winning 11 races to claim his second drivers' championship. His crowning achievement came in 2020 when he equaled Michael Schumacher's legendary record with his seventh world title.</p>
        <p style="color: #ccc; line-height: 1.8;">His move to Ferrari in 2025 is considered one of the most surprising transfers in the history of the sport. With 105 wins to his name, Hamilton brings immense championship experience to Maranello in pursuit of an eighth world title that would break the record alongside the most iconic team in F1.</p>
